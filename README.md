# getNya
Parody Java application for viewing and downloading anime pictures from Zerochan.net.

Supposed to have the worst kind of wrong OOP usage and other common imperfections you can find talking to a fanboy or a very interested person. Still working though.

You can find images by size and tags.
It's simple.
And flat.
